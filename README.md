**WARNING**

Merely compiling & executing main.cpp file cannot make sense..

Because the size of the example input files is so big that I decide not to contain them in this repo.

Please download MNIST handwritten digits files on [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and put them into `examples/MNIST` folder.
